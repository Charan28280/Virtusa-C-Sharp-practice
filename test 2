//for ex there are n=7 socks with colors
//ar={1,2,1,2,1,3,2} there is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2 there odd socks left, one of each color. the number of pairs is 2

//function desp
//complete the sockmerchant func in the editor below it must return an int resp the num of matching pairs of socks that are available
//n: the nu of socks in the pile
//ar: the color of each socks.
//input
//first line contains an int n the nu of socks resp in ar
// second line contains n space int desp the color ar[i] of the socks in the pile

//const  1<=n<=100  1<=ar[i]<=100& 0<=i<n
//output 
//return total nu of matching pairs of socks that all can sell.

// in 9
// 10 20 20 10 10 30 50 10 20
// output 3
//exp: alex can match 3 pairs of socks i.e 10-10, 10-10, 20-20, while the left out socks are 50, 60,20.
